A prototype for learning pitching.
Allopws you to scan qrcodes generated by the app and collect them. Real life treasure hunt of sorts.

Start with ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (hopefully in a virtual env)
If you use postgresql as your databse, install ```psycopg2```
Afterwards ```qrtrack-deploy`` command wil be working which allows you to deploy django app.

Configure to your needs and startup like always.
